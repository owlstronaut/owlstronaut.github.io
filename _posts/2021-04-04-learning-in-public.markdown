### What is it?

I recently picked up [The Coding Career Handbook](https://www.learninpublic.org/) as it was used as a reference from [Staff Engineer: Leadership beyond the management track](https://amzn.to/31NCzQJ). The author, [@swyx](https://twitter.com/swyx) has quickly advanced and built up an impressive career in coding since leaving his job on Wall Street. His main advice is to learn as much as you can in public!

### Why #LearnInPublic?

@swyx covers a lot of reasons why, and they've certainly resonated with me.

#### Build Learning Exhaust

This was perhaps my favorite reason to start learning in public. I can learn a lot in private, but there is no record of it anywhere. That means that whenever I talk to a recruiter for a new position, I am starting from scratch! They can look at my resum√©, but that doesn't impart any proof of my claims. I'd much rather show some of my work, built up over a long period of time, to give an evaluator some baseline insight into my experience. One of my least favorite things in the world is preparing for coding interviews - studying esoteric, [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) style problems to get a job that has little to do with the actual work. I'd argue that most good developers stay at their current jobs just to avoid the broken interview process at big tech companies today.

Also discussed is the ability of learning exhaust to create relationships and friendships. By writing about your learning, others with similar problems to figure out can learn as well. Maybe they will reach out, as they know you've already walked the path they are beginning.

#### The Learning Sticks

Writing about a subject causes you to form a framework, organizing the information in your head. Creating well organized information takes thought and effort. Instead of the normal jumbled mess, I expect what I'm writing down now will solidify. The power of [deep work](https://amzn.to/3rOYOjZ) is truly amazing. 

Furthermore, I will absolutely be [wrong on the internet](https://xkcd.com/386/) often.

If I ever get an audience, I'm sure I'll hear about when I'm wrong, and I'll never forget what I've learned!

### So You are Making a Commitment to this?

Oh no, absolutely not. If this isn't a fun way to learn, I'll just make myself feel bad for not meeting a goal of 1 post a week or 1000 words a day. In the end, I want the learning to be fun and I want it to stick. It'd be great to build a network from it as well!

#### Cheers! #LearnInPublic
